# The Best Startup Pitch Deck - By Sky Fernandes

Excerpts from [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/Sky7777/the-best-startup-pitch-deck-how-to-present-to-angels-v-cs)

Top pitch deck guidelines:

* Suggested core slide deck: 15-30 slides (see "The best Pitch Deck Outline")
* There are not correct # of slide, only key pieces that need to be covered
* Typical deck variations: 2 minutes & 5 slides, 5 minutes & 10 slides, 10-20 minutes & 15-30 slides.
* Keep slides clen, no clutter: 1-5 bullets/slide, 5-10 words/bullet, big clear images.
* Show, down't tell: don't be cocky/braggy/hyperbolic; show amazing/awesome results.
* Show "super simple" images, graphics, and diagrams (that need little or no explanation).
* Key takeaways: concisely summarize main points at the top or bottom of slides.
* Deck should be simple & clear enough to explain itself, and not need you to present it.
* When presenting, have addition info & insight to share with each slide = your added value.
* Check for typos, math errors, or internal inconsistencies (e.g. # of widgets on slide A vs B)
* Use consistent formatting: capitals vs. lowercase, colors, fonts, sizes, spacings, etc.
* Use font type Arial because it has no odd looking letters and is easy to read.
* Use font size 20 or larger, otherwise it's too hard read from a distance.
* Don't use dashes "-" as bullets because they look negative; use styled bullets.
* Add page numbers (bottom right of page).
* Use dark backgrounds with light text colors, or white backgrounds with black/dark fonts.

Words of wisdom:

* There is no right number of slides, ony critial points that you need to cover.
* Be 10x better at one thing vs. doing 10x more things. Being 2-3x better isnnt good engouh.
* Focus on your cusomters' #1 problem, not #1d problem.
* Prepare yourself for rejection. Ask wy and learn. Dn't take it personally.
* There are lots of great ideas, but few can execute them.
* Time is your biggetst enemy. Build quick and cheap, and iterate, iterate, iterate. Pivot when needed.
* Biggest competition to raising capital: companies with equally great (or better) ideas and teams, plus more traction at your stage (if you were a VC, which would you pick?)
* Best opportunity: a big growing marketing, with a big problem, and an elegant solution, where you can acieve LTV > CAC.
* You do'nt know-- the market does! Ask often.

Top investor quesetions about the company:

* What's the company history?
* Why are you creating this?
* How did you find your team members? Why are you and your team the right people for this?
* What's your target market size? What's your projected market penetration each year?
* What's your traction to date? (MVP done? User/revenue growth? Key milestones?)
* Why will you succeed? What are your special/sustainable competitive advantages?
* Why will you fail? Wat are your biggest challenges to success?
* Show me how you achieve the magic ratio: customer life-time value (LTV) > customer acquisition & maintenance cost (CAC + CMC).

Top investor quesetions about capital raising:

* What's the capital raising history of the company? How much and on what terms?
* When did you start raising this round? What investors have hard committed vs. soft committed?
* How much money have you and your teammates invested?
* How much money have your advisors and board members invested?
* What's your valuation? Terms?
* How much cash is in the bank?
* What's your monthly burn rate? (Expenses not covered by operating cash flow from revenues?)
* What's your runway? (How many months do you have before you run out of cash?)
* What are your use of proceeds? (How are you planning to spend he capital?)
