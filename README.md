## What is a pitch deck a.k.a. slide deck?

A pitch deck is a business slideshow presentation.

  * It summarizes the business idea of a startup company,
    and the business model, team, goals, needs, and more.

  * A carefully crafted pitch deck is a fundraising fundamental, and is
    often requested by investors prior to a company’s pitch presentation.

The SixArm.com pitch deck is a quick start. When you create the pitch deck, you can use it as a start to expand your deck into a formal investor pitch deck (described in the next section).
